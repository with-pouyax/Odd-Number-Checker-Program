# Odd Number Checker Program

In this JavaScript task, I've crafted a program to determine whether a given number is even (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Here's how it unfolds:

I declare six variables within the script:
num1 is assigned the value 2.
num2 is assigned the value 5.
test1 is assigned the result of the calculation num1 % 2.
test2 is assigned the result of the calculation num2 % 2.
result1 is assigned the outcome of checking if the number in test1 is not equal to 0 (test1 == 0).
result2 is assigned the outcome of checking if the number in test2 is not equal to 0 (test2 == 0).
After setting up these variables, I use console logs to display the results:
The first log checks if num1 is an even number and prints the result: Is 2 an even number? true.
The second log checks if num2 is an even number and prints the result: Is 5 an even number? false.
This logic utilizes the modulus operator (%) to efficiently determine the evenness of numbers.

Feel free to run this code and observe the expected console output as described above.
